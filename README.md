# InspectorJ
InspectorJ is a tool that combines static flow analyses with dynamic checks in Java programs to automatically detect security vulnerabilities. The tool is able to handle subtyping polymorphism and is able to detect  timing and command injection attacks. Also, the tool inserts instrumentation in Java programs to prevent the execution of unsafe parts of the code.
To this end, we use the Soot framework for code analysis and optimization.
